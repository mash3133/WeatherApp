# WeatherApp
I want to create an application, more precisely, a weather application. I want to create the GUI and learn how to make API calls. The purpose is to gain more experience in mobile application development and an effort to create projects outside of school or work environment 

Main Learning Outcome: Using Openweathermap.org API to retrieve information from a json file
